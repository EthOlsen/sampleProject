Simple Task Tracker

Description: Build a simple web-based task tracking app that allows users to:

Create tasks with a title, description, and due date.
View a list of all tasks.
Mark tasks as completed.
Delete tasks.
The app should have a simple front-end interface and use a back-end with a database to store the tasks.

 

Project Requirements:
Front-End (JavaScript)
Use plain JavaScript or a framework/library like React if preferred
The interface should include:
A form for adding tasks (title, description, and due date).
A table or list for displaying tasks.
Buttons or controls to mark tasks as completed or delete them.
Add basic input validation (e.g., the title and due date should not be empty).
Back-End (SQL skills)
Use a lightweight back-end server framework (e.g., Node.js with Express).
Create a database to store tasks (SQLite or PostgreSQL or other)
Tasks should have the following fields:
ID (primary key)
Title (string)
Description (string, optional)
Due Date (date)
Completed (boolean)
